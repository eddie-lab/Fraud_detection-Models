# Fraud_detection-Models

Our objective is to develop  three machine learning models to accurately classify credit card fraud in a dataset collected from European transactions over a two-day period in September 2013. Our chosen models include logistic regression, k-means clustering, and a neural network.

One of the primary challenges we encountered right from the beginning is the significant class imbalance in the dataset, with fraud transactions representing only 0.172% of the total. This imbalance poses a greater risk of false negatives, where fraudulent transactions go undetected, compared to false positives, which may cause minor inconveniences for cardholders during verification.

Our main goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in identifying credit card fraud, prioritizing the minimization of false negatives. This approach aims to ensure that fraudulent activities are detected and prevented, protecting cardholders from potential financial losses. While false positives may occur occasionally, they can be managed through verification procedures without significant harm.

By addressing these challenges and implementing our machine learning models, we aim to provide an effective solution that enhances fraud detection capabilities and safeguards the financial security of credit card users.
